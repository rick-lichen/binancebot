# binancebot
A automatic trading bot that uses Binance's API to calculate key TA Indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and trades according to strategies I set up. \
Did some backtesting based on historical data and selected "profitable strategies" \
Deployed to Heroku and ran for two weeks. Ended up losing $2k. To be fair the market was bad but this shows many other factors still need to be considered and likely constantly adjusted for a trading bot to be profitable long term.
